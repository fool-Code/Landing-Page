# Landing-Page
For this project I'm going to create an entire web page from a provided design.
The font thatâ€™s being used in the images is roboto.
## Desired Outcome

## Final Outcome close to desired

I called as final just because the design is quite close as desired. 
But I'm willing to change, inserting images.
